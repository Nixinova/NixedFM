# NixedFM

> Extremely WIP

Track your entire music listening journey and organise your music library!

Simply import your history from Last.FM and/or Spotify &ndash; that's all you need to do!

This website is basically a modern replacement for the Last.FM website, fixing many issues that have been plaguing Last.FM for years (decades!) without even a hint of a fix, such as broken redirects, misapplied tags, and duplication.
